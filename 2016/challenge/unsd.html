<h1 id="unsd-classifications-isic-and-cpc">UNSD classifications: ISIC and CPC</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>ISIC and CPC are explicitly in the scope of the IMS project. This means that their latest versions (ISIC Rev.4 and CPC Ver.2.1 at the time of writing), as well as the correspondences between items of those versions should be included in the RDF database. Also, in order to provide use cases related to the evolution in time of classifications, it was decided to include the previous versions of both classifications, as well as the associated historical correspondences. Because of the correspondence structure between ISIC and CPC, this implies in fact to include in the system the last three versions of the CPC, which align with the last two versions of the ISIC.</p>
<p>The authoritative source for the UNSD classifications is the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/">UNSD classification registry</a>, and in particular the download page at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp. The information is available in several formats and languages. Only PDF, MS Access and online HTML have the explanatory notes, and only Access and HTML have the latest corrections. Additional sources provided by the UNSD include, amongst others, French and Spanish labels and correspondence tables (which are only available in English).</p>
<h2 id="extraction-tools">Extraction tools</h2>
<p>MS Access is a proprietary format, but there are free and open source tools to read it, so it seems logical to use the Access files as main data sources. [Jackcess] (http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/), which is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, is used to read the databases. The additional labels and correspondence tables are given in CSV files and can be read easily with <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/">Apache CSV Commons</a>. Note that the CSV files containing additional languages are encoded using the ANSI (Cp1252) character set; this is expected by the program.</p>
<h2 id="details-on-the-sources">Details on the sources</h2>
<p>For <strong>ISIC Rev.4</strong>, the following sources were used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=135">ISIC_Rev_4_english_database.zip</a> for most of the data regarding ISIC Rev.4, including structure, English labels and explanatory notes</li>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=189">ISIC_Rev_4_french.zip</a> for additional French ISIC Rev.4 labels.</li>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=198">ISIC_Rev_4_spanish.zip</a> for additional Spanish ISIC Rev.4 labels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding files for <strong>ISIC Rev.3.1</strong> are: * <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=172">ISIC_Rev.3.1_database_english.zip</a> for the main data * <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=105">ISIC_Rev_3_1_spanish_structure.zip</a> for the Spanish labels * French labels for ISIC Rev.3.1 do not seem to be available.</p>
<p>For <strong>CPC</strong>, the following sources were used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=287">CPCv21_database_english.zip</a>, which contain the structure, English labels and notes for version 2.1</li>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=235">CPCv2_database_english.zip</a>, which contain the structure, English labels and notes for version 2</li>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=279">CPCv2_spanish.zip</a>, which gives the Spanish labels for version 2</li>
<li>Labels for other languages or Spanish labels for version 2.1 do not seem to be available</li>
<li><a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=182">CPCv1.1_database_english.zip</a>, which contain the structure, English labels and notes for version 1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding <strong>correspondence tables</strong> (all files are zipped CSV):</p>
<ul>
<li>Between ISIC revisions 3.1 and 4: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=121">ISIC31-ISIC4.zip</a></li>
<li>Between CPC versions 2 and 2.1: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=291">CPCv2_CPCv21.zip</a></li>
<li>Between CPC versions 1.1 and 2: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=127">CPCv11_CPCv2.zip</a></li>
<li>Between ISIC revision 4 and CPC version 2.1: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=289">ISIC4_CPCv21.zip</a></li>
<li>Between ISIC revision 4 and CPC version 2: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=261">ISIC4-CPC2.zip</a>. Note that this file contains a invalid line (&quot;83960&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;n/a&quot;) which is ignored by the program.</li>
<li>Between ISIC revision 3.1 and CPC version 1.1: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdntransfer.asp?f=45">ISIC_Rev_3_1-CPC_V1_1.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following precisions are copied from the &quot;readme&quot; files available in the archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The correspondence between CPC versions 2 and 2.1 does not yet include divisions 61 and 62 of the CPC.</li>
<li>The correspondence between ISIC Rev.4 and CPC Ver.2.1 does not yet include divisions 45, 46 and 47 of ISIC.</li>
<li>The correspondence between ISIC Rev.4 and CPC Ver.2 does not yet include divisions 45-47 of ISIC. Note also that waste products of the CPC (i.e. those in division 39) are not linked to an ISIC industry.</li>
<li>Regarding the correspondence between ISIC Rev.3.1 and CPC Ver.1.1, please note that certain products in the CPC (e.g. waste products in CPC division 39) are not linked to specific industries.</li>
</ul>
<p>All files should be put in the main/resources/data folder and unzipped before running the programs.</p>
<h2 id="details-on-the-outputs">Details on the outputs</h2>
<p>The following Turtle files are produced by the programs:</p>
<ul>
