        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The SemStats 2016 challenge data sets includes data about the central economic
            classifications published by the UNSD and Eurostat, as well as some national
            classifications that are articulated with the central classifications. The international
            economic classifications form a very coherent system which is, for example, described
            briefly on <a
                href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=NACE_background"
                >this page</a>.</p>
        <p>For the challenge data, a subset of this central system is made available as RDF,
            completed with national classifications. Previous versions of the central
            classifications are also included in order to provide use cases related to the evolution
            in time of the classification system.</p>
        <p>More precisely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The classification of economic activities at UN level is the ISIC. The last two
                versions of ISIC, revisions 3.1 and 4 are included, as well as the historical
                correspondence table between them.</li>
            <li>At the European statistical system (ESS) level, a refinement of the ISIC, called
                NACE, is used. Here again, the last two versions are included in the challenge data:
                NACE revision 1.1 and NACE revision 2. The historical correspondence between these
                two versions is also included, as well as the hierarchical correspondences between
                NACE revision 2 and ISIC revision 4.</li>
            <li>The following national activity classifications for the following countries are also
                provided in their latest versions: France and Italy (NAF and Ateco with their
                hierarchical correspondence to NACE), and US (NAICS and its correspondence with
                ISIC).</li>
            <li>Regarding products, the UN classification is the CPC (Central Products
                Classification). The last two versions of the CPC (versions 2 and 2.1) are
                articulated with ISIC Rev. 4. The previous version (1.1) is articulated with ISIC
                Rev. 3.1. All these classifications and tables are included in the data sets.</li>
            <li>The ESS classification for products is the CPA. Its articulation with NACE is
                similar to what exists between CPC and ISIC: the last two versions of the CPA
                (versions 2008 and 2.1) are articulated with NACE Rev. 2, and the previous version
                (2002) is articulated with NACE Rev. 1.1. Only versions 2008 and 2.1 of the CPC are
                included, with their historical correspondence and their correspondences with NACE
                Rev. 2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following picture gives an overview of the challenge data: the yellow dots represent
            the classifications and the yellow lines the correspondence tables.</p>

        <p>The details on the sources and the production processes used to create the RDF files can be found:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For UN-level classifications, on <a href="unsd.html">this page</a></li>
            <li>For European classifications, on <a href="eurostat.html">this page</a></li>
            <li>For national classifications, on <a href="national.html">this page</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="vocabularies">Vocabularies</h2>
        <p>The main RDF vocabulary used for representing classifications is <a
                href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/RDF/XKOS">XKOS</a>, published by the
            DDI Alliance. XKOS extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos">SKOS</a> and is
            aligned with the Neuch√¢tel model and the GSIM classification model, which are the
            business models used by statisticians.</p>
