## Workshop Summary
The goal of this workshop is to explore and strengthen the relationship between the Semantic Web and statistical communities, to provide better access to the data held by statistical offices. It will focus on ways in which statisticians can use Semantic Web technologies and standards in order to formalize, publish, document and link their data and metadata, and also on how statistical methods can be applied on linked data. It is the fifth workshop in a series that started at the International Semantic Web Conference in 2013 (SemStats 2013) and run since every year at ISWC.


## Topics
The workshop will address topics related to statistics and linked data. This includes but is not limited to:

### How to publish linked statistics?
* What are the relevant vocabularies for the publication of statistical data?
* What are the relevant vocabularies for the publication of statistical metadata (code lists and classifications, descriptive metadata, provenance and quality information, etc.)?
* What are the existing tools? Can the usual statistical software packages (e.g. R, SAS, Stata) do the job?
* How do we include linked data production and publication in the data lifecycle?
* How do we establish, document and share best practices?

### How to use linked data for statistics?
* Where and how can we find statistics data: data catalogues, dataset descriptions, data discovery?
* How do we assess data quality (collection methodology, traceability, etc.)?
* How can we perform data reconciliation, ontology matching and instance matching with statistical data?
* How can we apply statistical processes on linked data: data analysis, descriptive statistics, estimation, correction?
* How to intuitively represent statistical linked data: visual analytics, results of data mining?

### How to use statistical methods on IoT data streams? 
* How can statistical processes be applied to Sensor streaming data at runtime and how can the results of these processes be stored and accessed?
* How can statistical and machine learning algorithms be used on time series data produced by IoT devices


## Contributions
The intended outcome of the workshop is to explore and strengthen the relations between the semantic web and statistical communities. Accordingly, one visible result will be a persistent website that summarizes what the workshop contributed to the understanding of these questions, thereby supplementing and integrating the traditional collection of articles that constitute the proceedings (which will be published in CEUR-WS.org, a recognized ISSN publication series, to ensure wide accessibility). As in the previous year, http://semstats.org/ will be used for this purpose.

The workshop will welcome the following types of contributions:
* Full and short articles (up to 12 and 6 "pages")
* Challenge articles (up to 12 "pages")
* Demo articles (up to 6 "pages")


## Awards
This year, SemStats will award prizes, thanks to the generous sponsoring from Oracle and CASD:
* The best full or short article will win 1000 EUR
* The best challenge article will win 500 EUR
* The best application or demo article will win 500 USD
